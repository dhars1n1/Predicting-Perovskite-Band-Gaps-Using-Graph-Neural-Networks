Description of Selected Columns from Cleaned Perovskite Dataset

- Ref_ID  
A unique internal numeric identifier for each sample entry in the dataset.  

- Ref_DOI_number  
Digital Object Identifier (DOI) corresponding to the source publication from which the data point was extracted.  

- Perovskite_single_crystal  
Boolean value indicating whether the perovskite sample is a single crystal.Crystal structure affects charge mobility, stability, and recombination properties in optoelectronic applications.

- Perovskite_dimension_3D_with_2D_capping_layer  
Indicates presence of a 2D material capping layer atop a 3D perovskite structure.Capping layers can improve stability and interface passivation in photovoltaic devices.

- Perovskite_dimension_list_of_layers  
A list of dimensional components that may include 0D, 2D, 2D3D mixtures, or 3D arrangements.  

- Perovskite_dimension_combined  
A synthesized label that classifies the overall dimensionality (e.g., “3D”, “2D”, “2D3D_mixture”).  

- Perovskite_composition_perovskite_ABC3_structure  
TRUE if the compound strictly follows the ABX₃ perovskite stoichiometry. Distinguishes canonical perovskites from non-ideal compositions.

- Perovskite_composition_perovskite_inspired_structure  
Indicates whether the compound is inspired by perovskite structure but deviates from ABX₃ format.Useful in generalizing across structural analogs.

- Perovskite_composition_a_ions  
List of cations at the A-site (e.g., FA⁺, MA⁺, Cs⁺). A-site ions contribute to lattice size, stability, and ionic transport properties.

- Perovskite_composition_a_ions_coefficients  
Stoichiometric values of each A-site ion.Enables modeling of partial substitution and mixed cation systems.

- Perovskite_composition_b_ions  
List of B-site metal cations (e.g., Pb²⁺, Sn²⁺).Core to electronic band structure and charge carrier properties.

- Perovskite_composition_b_ions_coefficients  
Stoichiometric ratios for each B-site element.Required for accurate representation of mixed-metal systems.

- Perovskite_composition_c_ions  
Halide or chalcogenide anions (e.g., I⁻, Br⁻, Cl⁻).Controls light absorption and degradation behavior.

- Perovskite_composition_c_ions_coefficients  
Stoichiometric contributions of each C-site anion.Essential for band gap tuning and lattice strain analysis.

- Perovskite_composition_short_form  
Compact chemical representation (e.g., MA0.85FA0.15PbI3).  

- Perovskite_composition_long_form  
Fully expanded compositional formula with precise stoichiometry.  

- Perovskite_composition_inorganic  
TRUE if the structure contains only inorganic ions (e.g., CsPbI3).Inorganic materials typically exhibit superior thermal and operational stability.

- Perovskite_composition_leadfree  
TRUE if no lead (Pb) is present.  

- Perovskite_additives_compounds  
Description: Additives used during synthesis (e.g., DMSO, MACl).  

- Perovskite_additives_concentrations  
Description: Concentrations of additives listed above (in M or wt%). 

- Perovskite_band_gap  
Description: Estimated band gap of the material in eV.

- Perovskite_band_gap_graded  
Description: Indicates if the band gap is intentionally graded across the depth of the film.

- Perovskite_pl_max  
Description: Peak photoluminescence wavelength (in nm).Indicates radiative recombination behavior and validates band gap estimates.

- Stability_temperature_min  
Description: Minimum temperature (in °C) that the device/material was subjected to during testing.  

- Stability_temperature_max  
Description: Maximum temperature (in °C) reached during stability experiments.
